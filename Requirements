    The system should consume CSV files which are dropped into a shared folder which are of the form item,attribute_name,attribute_value. The CSV files will be dropped into the shared folder at any point in time.
    The system should be able to notify the attribute changes for items to different subscribers based on different configurable conditions
    The notifications can be sent on any asynchronous messaging system
    The system should also be able to support queries to get all the attributes for a given item at any time
    The system should be scalable to
        accept large number of/large sized CSV files
        support large number of subscriber configurations
        support high throughput and low latency on the get query
